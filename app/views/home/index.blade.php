My name is Michael Potiska. I just graduated from the University of North Texas with my B.A. in Converged Broadcast Media with a focus in online, corporate, and news media. Iâ€™ve had an interest in media producing, editing, and implementation since elementary school, and want to continue following this passion with a company who shares the same mindset.
